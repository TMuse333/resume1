        <p>From September 2021 to  May 2023, I attended Dalhousie for two years doing computer science.
            This experience gave me a very strong background in understanding complex theories and how computers work,
            along with coding skills and I even made this website myself! It was a solid experience and I am ready to head
            into the real world and sharpen my sales skills and make you a lot of money while doing it!
