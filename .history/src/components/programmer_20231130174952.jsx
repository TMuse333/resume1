        <p>From September 2021 to May 2023, I completed two years of computer science at Dalhousie University. This education enriched my understanding of complex theories, computer systems, and coding. Additionally, I independently developed this website, demonstrating my technical prowess. Now, I am well-prepared to transition into the professional world, eager to refine my sales skills and make you a lot of money.
